-- Over the 12 days of her data challenge, Data Dawn tracked her daily quiz scores across different subjects. Can you find each subject's first and last recorded score to see how much she improved?

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: daily_quiz_scores
--   subject: VARCHAR
--   quiz_date: DATE
--   score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

WITH ScoreRanges AS (
    SELECT
        subject,
        score,
        -- Get the first score based on the earliest date
        FIRST_VALUE(score) OVER (
            PARTITION BY subject 
            ORDER BY quiz_date ASC
        ) AS first_score,
        -- Get the last score based on the most recent date
        FIRST_VALUE(score) OVER (
            PARTITION BY subject 
            ORDER BY quiz_date DESC
        ) AS last_score
    FROM daily_quiz_scores
)
SELECT DISTINCT
    subject,
    first_score,
    last_score,
    (last_score - first_score) AS improvement
FROM ScoreRanges
ORDER BY subject;
